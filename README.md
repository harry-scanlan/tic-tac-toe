# tic-tac-toe
Follow along project with FreeCodeCamp.

Followed along with an online tutorial from FreeCodeCamp.

A somewhat easy to follow project that looked at using user input,
randomisation and time in python. Even after following the video the
code featured a number of bugs, which was actually benficial in tracing back
and understanding problems such as syntax errors and indentations.
